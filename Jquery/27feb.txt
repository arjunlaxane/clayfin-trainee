Advantages and disadvantages of AJAX



Pros −

Allows applications to render without data and fill data as the application gets it from the server.

Gives platform independence to application developers

Faster page renders

More responsive applications

No rerenders of whole pages are needed to update only a single area.

Cons−

Any user whose browser does not support JavaScript or XMLHttpRequest, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax.

Multiple server requests need more data consumed at the client-side.

Failure of any one request can fail the load of the whole page.

Browsers with JS disabled will not be able to use pages using ajax.
