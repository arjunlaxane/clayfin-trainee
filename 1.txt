What is DOM:

->

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.DOM represents an HTML document in memory and uses APIs to create web content and applications.

->It is a platform and language independent model to represent the HTML or XML documents. It defines the logical structure of the documents and the way in which they can be accessed and manipulated by an application program.


In the DOM, all parts of the document, such as elements, attributes, text, etc. are organized in a hierarchical tree-like structure; similar to a family tree in real life that consists of parents and children. In DOM terminology these individual parts of the document are known as nodes.

The Document Object Model that represents HTML document is referred to as HTML DOM. Similarly, the DOM that represents the XML document is referred to as XML DOM.

HTML DOM  provides a standard interface for accessing and manipulating HTML documents through JavaScript. With the HTML DOM, you can use JavaScript to build HTML documents, navigate their hierarchical structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and attributes or their content, and so on. Almost anything found in an HTML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the JavaScript with the help of HTML DOM.


Document node is the root node of the DOM tree, which has one child, the <html> element. Whereas, the <head> and <body> elements are the child nodes of the <html> parent node.

The <head> and <body> elements are also siblings since they are at the same level. Further, the text content inside an element is a child node of the parent element. So, for example, "Mobile OS" is considered as a child node of the <h1> that contains it.

Comments inside the HTML document are nodes in the DOM tree as well, even though it doesn't affect the visual representation of the document in any way. Comments are useful for documenting the code, however, you will rarely need to retrieve and manipulate them.

HTML attributes such as id, class, title, style, etc. are also considered as nodes in DOM hierarchy but they don't participate in parent/child relationships like the other nodes do. They are accessed as properties of the element node that contains them.

What is CSSOM?

->The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically. The values of CSS are represented untyped, that is using String objects.

What is CSS selectors?

->
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

What’s the difference between npm and npx in JavaScript?

->

The command npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager, and npx is used to execute JavaScript packages downloaded this way.


This command will download the NPM package create-react-app to a subdirectory of the current working directory named node_modules:
npm install create-react-app

This command will execute the NPM package create-react-app with the name argument myreactapp, creating a bare-bones React app in the subdirectory myreactapp:

npx create-react-app myreactapp


 npm 

npx

->
If you wish to run package through npm then you have to specify that package in your package.json and install it locally.

	A package can be executable without installing the package. It is an npm package runner so if any packages aren’t already installed it will install them automatically.


->To use `create-react-app` in npm the commands are `npm install create-react-app` then `create-react-app myApp` (Installation required).	

In npx you can create a react app without installing the package:
`npx create-react-app myApp`
This command is required in every app’s life cycle only once.


->Npm is a tool that use to install packages.

	 Npx is a tool that use to execute packages.

->Packages used by npm are installed globally. You have to care about pollution in the long term.

	 Packages used by npx are not installed globally. You don’t have to worry about for pollution in the long term.

What is angular vs react ?
->

->Angular is a Full-fledged framework	whereas JavaScript is a library

->DOM TYPE:Angular has a Real DOM where as React has 	Virtual DOM

->Data binding: In Angular data binding is	Bidirectional data binding	where as react has Unidirectional data binding

->Abstraction is strong in react whereas it's	Medium in angular.

->JavaScript library inclusion in source code	Not possible in angular whereas it's	Doable in react

->Model is	MVC model in angular whereas it's	Virtual DOM in react


->In angular Testing and debugging	Complete solution is present within a single tool whereas in react it	Needs an additional set of tools


->In case of angular,Freedom is 	Limited	 whereas in react it Allows a choice of libraries, architecture, and tools
